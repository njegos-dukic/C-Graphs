# Operations with Graphs in C

**Algorithms and Data Structures**

- In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from the field of graph theory within mathematics.
- A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices (also called nodes or points), together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. 
- These pairs are known as edges (also called links or lines), and for a directed graph are also known as arrows. 
- The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.
- A graph data structure may also associate to each edge some edge value, such as a symbolic label or a numeric attribute (cost, capacity, length, etc.).

- Creating linked list representation of directed unweighted graph specified from input .txt file.
- Input file contains matrix representation of the same graph.
- Implements BFS (Breadth - First Search) as well as DFS (Depth - First Searach) and outputs each visited node.
